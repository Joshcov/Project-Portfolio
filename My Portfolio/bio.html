        <h2>This is my Bio </h2>
            <p>I believe getting to know a bit of the history of one's life could be the first step of good opportunities, however, I will use the great chance to put my story out there. I'm Joshua, Ghanaian born, age 30, raised and cared for by a single mother. I'm a child of two and growing up was tough because we didn't have a lot of opportunities but that didn't stop us from striving to pave the way for a better future.
                 I've always been curious about technology growing up, how it works, how people could just give a command to something to make it work, it didn't just give me goosebumps but also a vision of what I'll want to do in the future.
                 I'm a very active person and dislike being stagnant at one place without any form of improvement, but lack of opportunities has made things tough for me. Since I completed High School,
                 I've always looked forward to traveling to different countries to study, lucky enough I had my first exchange program to study in Brazil pursuing a study in technology. 
                I was excited about the chance but the Portuguese language became a conflict so I had to put in much effort.
                 There have been ups and downs living here in Brazil for almost 7 years now, it was my case to live for long here but I guess that's life. Moreover, 
                I took the decision to study systems analysis and development recently since I'm now back on track, I'm still a freshman in this field, but my dream is to become a Front-end developer for beginners and as I attain more experience in the field, to become a Back-end developer then Fullstuck, but that won't be it, I'll want to study about AI and Machine learning. 
                I know I have a long way to go that's why I'm looking for a chance to work as an intern with Front-end. I hope  I've given some closure to who I am and will find it appealing.</p>
